SOA means that you structure your application by decomposing it into multiple services 
(most commonly as HTTP services) that can be classified as different types like subsystems or tiers.
That application should not show how it works inside - client or other service can work obly with external interface,
service must introduce the interface and rules of interaction. Also service should take care of data consistency and
could fix themself without any help.
